🎯 Project Overview

Construction Field Management Application is a modern web-based solution built to simplify and digitize construction site operations.

The application provides real-time visibility into project progress, workforce attendance, and site activities, helping engineers, managers, and owners make informed decisions.

This project demonstrates:

✔️ Real-world problem solving

✔️ Scalable frontend architecture

✔️ Industry-relevant construction workflows

❗ Problem Statement

Most construction sites rely on unstructured communication methods such as:

WhatsApp messages

Phone calls

Paper-based registers

These approaches result in:

❌ Data loss

❌ No centralized tracking

❌ Poor accountability

❌ Delayed decision-making

As a result, owners and managers lack real-time insights into on-site activities.

✅ Solution Overview

This application introduces a centralized digital platform that standardizes site operations by:

Digitizing daily progress reports

Structuring attendance and material data

Providing dashboards for management

Improving transparency and accountability

The solution is designed to work efficiently in low-connectivity, real construction environments.

✨ Key Highlights

🗂️ Centralized project management

📝 Digital Daily Progress Reports (DPR)

📍 Workforce attendance tracking

📦 Material request & usage monitoring

📊 Management dashboards & reports

📱 Mobile-first and user-friendly design
